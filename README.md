## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI Question Generation
- **Cohere Command Model**: Generates contextually appropriate questions
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for consistent output format
- **JSON Validation**: Ensures generated questions meet required format
- **Fallback System**: Backup questions when AI generation fails

### Adaptive Learning Algorithm
```python
def adjust_difficulty(current_difficulty, performance_score):
    if performance_score >= 0.8:    # 80%+ correct - increase difficulty
        return increase_level(current_difficulty)
    elif performance_score <= 0.4:  # 40%- correct - decrease difficulty
        return decrease_level(current_difficulty)
    else:
        return current_difficulty    # maintain current level
```

### Data Flow
1. User Authentication → Session Management
2. Test Configuration → AI Question Generation
3. Question Delivery → User Response Collection
4. Performance Calculation → Analytics Update
5. Difficulty Adjustment → Personalized Recommendations
